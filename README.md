# Food Menu

Once again in the theme of my favorite fantasy.  This restaurant website utilizes React, Components, Router, Switch and Sass features to get to the end result.  I enjoyed building this real life application.  It reminded me of the need ofr simple creative ways to dispay information to the user.  Also using GraphQL through Graph.Cool we were able to stre and modify the data on an API.  This is so useful.  I can't wait t use these features in the future.
